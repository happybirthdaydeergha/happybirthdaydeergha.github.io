    <h2>Hi! Babe</h2>
    <p class="bio">ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰Many Many Happy Returns of the day ðŸŽŠðŸŽŠ
I know i am nothing close to what you deserve but no one will love you more than I do, I can say this much.So anyway, here I'm. I would like to wish you a very very  ðŸŽŠHappy Birthday Bacha.ðŸŽŠ.<br>
I am an idiot, an idiot who's in love with a girl(that's you btw),irrespective of if she's there with me or not, its a contingency plan, if i could be not there for your birthday, so here i am doing the best i can to wish you. So mere taraf se ek chota sa birthday gift, in my own original style. It's not a very big of deal but it's my way of saying that you are special to me and I love you so so much. I want you to know that I may not be a good person, a person who you look up to with respect, dignity or trust but i can assure you that am not a bad person, han i mean i know that it's too early to believe it, but I'll be always there for you and that's a promise. So i will be really happy agar tum ye dekh kar thoda sa aasun(khusi wale) baha do tab...hahaha kidding...dont cry. Keep scrolling!</p>

        Nashe karne padte hai kai tab jaakr jhoom pata hun
Tu aajati hai samne jo mere, pal bhar me hi dag-maga sa jata hun
Aisi chize pehle bhi mili thi mujhe jo kadwi thi, mai janta tha kharab hai
Shahed jaisi ghul kar jo kabhi utarti nahi thi, tu aisi konsi meethi sharab hai
Tere sath hota hun to jaise, mera kirdaar kahi kho jata hai
Jitni bar dekhun tujhe utni baar, mujhe tujhse ishq hojata hai
Jo hath pakar kar rok le mujhe, to phero tak phir se utha nahi jata hai
Itni masumiyat kaise bhar jati hai in ankhon me, ki zyda der inse rootha bhi nahi jata hai
Teri zulfo ke dhakke bhar se, mai din bhar muskurata hun
Jo chu leti hai galti se, to ek lamhe me puri zindagi ji ata hun
Ankh khule to khayal terra aaye, jo band ho to deedar hai tu
Happy Birthday Meri jaan!
